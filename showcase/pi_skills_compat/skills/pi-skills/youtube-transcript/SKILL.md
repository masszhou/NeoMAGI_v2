Derived from badlogic/pi-skills@75d32a382b0c8aafce356d68e17d2dc94c0c953b (MIT). NeoMAGI additions document execution and safety boundaries.

## NeoMAGI execution boundary

Run every command from this skill through NeoMAGI's governed `bash` tool so shell policy, timeout, audit logging, truncation, and artifact handling remain active. Commands using `{baseDir}` are resolved by NeoMAGI during `/skill:<name>` expansion to this skill's `location` path.

## Setup check

```bash
node --version && echo "node found" || echo "node missing"
test -f "{baseDir}/package.json" && echo "package.json found" || echo "package.json missing"
test -d "{baseDir}/node_modules" && echo "dependencies installed" || echo "run npm install in {baseDir}"
```

## Credentials

No credential is required for public videos with available transcripts.

## Sensitive operations

Only use public video IDs or URLs. Do not pass private, tokenized, or access-controlled URLs without same-turn user confirmation.

## Output hygiene

Do not record API keys, OAuth tokens, cookies, private email bodies, private Drive file contents, browser profile data, or non-public audio/transcript content in durable logs, findings, or summaries. Redact identifiers unless the user explicitly asks to preserve them.

## Failure mode

If a dependency, credential, OAuth account, browser, or transcript is unavailable, stop and report the missing prerequisite plus the next setup command. Do not continue by guessing, printing secret values, or switching to another external service without user approval.

# YouTube Transcript

Fetch transcripts from YouTube videos.

## Setup

```bash
cd {baseDir}
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
{baseDir}/transcript.js <video-id-or-url>
```

Accepts video ID or full URL:
- `EBw7gsDPAYQ`
- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBw7gsDPAYQ`
- `https://youtu.be/EBw7gsDPAYQ`

## Output

Timestamped transcript entries:

```
[0:00] All right. So, I got this UniFi Theta
[0:15] I took the camera out, painted it
[1:23] And here's the final result
```

## Notes

- Requires the video to have captions/transcripts available
- Works with auto-generated and manual transcripts
